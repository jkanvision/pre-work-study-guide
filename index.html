        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style with CSS: inline, internal, and external.</li>
          <li>External styling provides compartmentalization for easier editing at a later time.</li>
          <li>CSS rules are called declarations, which are comprised of:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>a selector that defines the element or attribute the definition is being applied to</li>
            <li>the CSS property being defined and its value</li>            
          </ul>
          <li>Each HTML element can be imagined as being contained in a box with layers of buffers surrounding the content:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The center is the content</li>
            <li>The next layer is the padding</li>
            <li>The next layer is the border</li>
            <li>The outermost layer is the margin</li>
          </ul>
          <li>An "*" appearing before a selector indicates that the declaration defining it will apply to ALL such elements on the page.</li>
          <li>A "." appearing before a selector indicates that it is a class selector.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>GitBash is a popular CLI that provides a terminal that uses UNIX commands to interact with the shell.</li>
          <li>Git commands used in GitBash enable you to commit local files to GitHub repositories.</li>
          <li>Common Git commands:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>cd: changes directory</li>
              <li>ls: lists files and folders in current directory</li>
              <li>git status: identifies current branch</li>
              <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and swiches to it</li>
              <li>git add -A: stages all changes made to current branch, preparing it for a commit</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript makes static webpages interactive.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store data.</li>
          <li>An "array" stores a group of related data in a variable.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Array values are enclosed in brackets.</li>
            <li>Each data item of an array corresponds to an "index number" based on its location in the sequence.</li>
            <li>The first data item of an array is assigned an index number of "0".</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Strings are always contained in quotation marks; booleon and numeric values are not.</li>
          <li>Each line of JavaScript code is followed by a semi-colon.</li>
          <li>The link to a JavaScript file should be placed just above the closing body tag of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. JavaScript, like most languages, executes from top to bottom. Order is important!</li>
          <li>A console log in the browser can be used to view and test code for the webpage.</li>
          <li>"If statements" include code that is conditional. They tell the program which tasks to execute when conditions are met.</li>
          <li>A "for loop" can perform tasks on multiple items by allowing a single code block to be executed repeatedly.</li>
          <li>"For loops" contain three important statements:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>a starting point;</li>
            <li>a condition to determine how long the loop will run;</li>
            <li>a value that indicates which data items are selected.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>A "function" is a set of instructions to perform a task. The name of a function is followed by parentheses.</li>
          <li>Functions must be defined and called (they do not automatically execute).</li>
